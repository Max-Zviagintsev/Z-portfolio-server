#### My personal web-developer portfolio. 
The app uses fully-decoupled (headless) **Drupal 8** as a content source and **React.js** as a front-End. 

GraphQL is used for the communication between Drupal and React.

The production app utilizes a modern "static website" approach to achieve maximum performance. For this purpose Gatsby.js static website generator is used.

This repository contains app server.
